Created an automatic game of Mario! Requires a file with 8 lines with percentages and numbers for things like, the number of lives Mario will have, how big the levels will be, and the chances of objects being placed in the world.

This was a project I had always heard from other students because it is the most challenging due to the fact that you don't have much to go off of from what you've learned in class. I agree that this was difficult until the due date but I enjoyed this assignment the most. Because we were making a game from scratch, it was a nice challenge to be able to create the puzzle pieces and put them together and where they belonged. I will never forget the satisfaction when I got it all working.

[See my code here](https://github.com/MaggieHillebrecht/Not-So-Super-Mario)

## The most difficult function
For me, writing the StartGame function was the hardest because I had to figure out where and how to put all of the pieces together. Looking back after over 6 months, I would have organized my code a lot more. I originally wanted to create inheritance within my work but got overwhelmed very quickly as I created all of the classes. I think now that is the biggest change I would do. With the function below, I found it easier when I went to a whiteboard and started drawing out a finite state machine with all of the functions I had coded up until that point.

```cpp
void OutFile::StartGame(string outputFile){
    /*I got help from Kaye in regards to logging in the game into the output file.
    Lines 57-63 and 158-159
    I had originally tried using the file processing method used for A1, however
    was very unsuccessful
    */
    ofstream loggerFile(outputFile);
    if (!loggerFile.is_open()) {
        cerr << "Failed to open output file: " << outputFile << endl;
        return; // Exit function if file opening fails
    }
    streambuf* coutToLogger = cout.rdbuf(); 
    cout.rdbuf(loggerFile.rdbuf()); //redirects all couts to the logger file

    int currentLevelPlayed = 0;
    bool isGameOver = false;

    // Create the levels
    for (int i = 0; i < amountOfLevels; ++i) {
        m_levels[i] = level->CreateLevel(i);
        level->DisplayLevel(i, -1, -1);
        cout << endl;
    }

    cout << "Mario is currently at (" << marioInWorld->getRowForMario() << ", "
        << marioInWorld->getColumnForMario() << ")" << endl;

    while (marioInWorld->getMarioLives() > 0 && !isGameOver) {
        // Game loop logic here...
    }
}
