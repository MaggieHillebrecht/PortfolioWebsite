Worked with a group of students to build an arcade machine for Chapman Fowler School of Engineering. 
I was apart of the microcontroller team to make sure the software, games, LEDS, marquees, and speakers worked. 
I also ended up doing a little bit of everything outside of my team as well! I did the art for the stream deck, helped decal the
art work to the panels, helped with assembly, and even place the tempered glass in.

## Besides this being a class, why did I join this project?

Before this became an official and funded class by Fowler, the professor overseeing this class had asked me over break if I would 
be interested in joining as a side project. I love being apart of projects, especially hands on where I can build anything (even if it isn't coding). 
I have always been the type of person where if I have a friend or a group of people who are passionate about a personal project, I try to help out as much 
as I can. That excitement and passion always radiates and makes me excited and passionate.
